US POLLUTION ANALYSIS: The comprehensive analysis of pollution levels across various US cities, conducted using Power BI, has provided critical insights into the concentrations of key pollutants: Carbon Monoxide (CO), Ozone (O3), Sulphur Dioxide (SO2), and Nitrogen Dioxide (NO2). The data visualization revealed several important trends and areas for improvement. Mexicali and Phoenix have shown exceptionally high levels of CO and NO2 respectively. Targeted interventions in these cities can significantly reduce pollution. States like California, Texas, and Oklahoma consistently show high levels of multiple pollutants. Implementing state-specific regulations and pollution control measures can help mitigate these levels. With O3 levels peaking at 211 ppm and SO2 levels at 351 ppb, strategies to reduce industrial emissions and enhance air quality standards are critical. Educating the public on pollution sources and health impacts, along with stricter enforcement of environmental policies, can lead to better compliance and reduction in pollution levels. This analysis underscores the need for robust pollution control measures, targeted interventions in high-impact areas, and continuous monitoring to ensure sustainable environmental health. By leveraging these insights, policymakers and environmental agencies can implement effective strategies to improve air quality and protect public health across the United States.
